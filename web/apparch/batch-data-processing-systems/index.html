				Batch data-processing systems			</h1>
			</header><div class="entry-content clearfix">
		<p>Businesses rely on data processing systems to support many aspects of their business such as paying salaries, calculating and printing invoices, maintaining accounts and issuing renewals for insurance policies. As the name implies, these systems focus on data and the databases that they rely on are usually orders of magnitude larger than the systems themselves.</p>
<p>Data processing systems are batch processing systems where data is input and output in batches from a file or database rather than input from and output to a user terminal. These systems select data from the input records and, depending on the value of fields in the records, take some actions specified in the program. They may then write back the result of the computation to the database and format the input and computed output for printing.</p>

An input-process-output model of a data processing system<br></figcaption></figure>
<p>The architecture of batch processing systems has three major components, as illustrated in the above diagram. An input component collects inputs from one or more sources; a processing component makes computations using these inputs; and an output component generates outputs to be written back to the database and printed. For example, a telephone billing system takes customer records and telephone meter readings (inputs) from an exchange switch, computes the costs for each customer (process) and then prints bills (outputs) for each customer.</p>
<p>The input, processing and output components may themselves be further decomposed into an input-process-output structure. For example:</p>
<ol><li>An input component may read some data (input) from a file or database, check the validity of that data and correct some errors (process), then queue the valid data for processing (output).</li>
<li>A processing component may take a transaction from a queue (input), perform some computations on the data and create a new data record recording the results of the computation (process), then queue this new record for printing (output). Sometimes the processing is done within the system database and sometimes it is a separate program.</li>
<li>An output component may read records from a queue (input), format these according to the output form (process), then send them to a printer or write new records back to the database (output).</li>
</ol><p>The nature of data processing systems where records or transactions are processed serially with no need to maintain state across transactions means that these systems are naturally function-oriented rather than object-oriented. Functions are components that do not maintain internal state information from one invocation to another. <a href="http://ifs.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Books/SE9/Web/Architecture/DFDs/index.html">Data-flow diagrams</a>, are a good way to describe the architecture of business data processing systems.</p>
