				Over-specifying reliability			</h1>
			</header><div class="entry-content clearfix">
		<p>The problem with specifying reliability using metrics such as POFOD, ROCOF and AVAIL is that it is possible to over-specify reliability and thus incur high development and validation costs. The reason for this is that system stakeholders find it difficult to translate their practical experience into quantitative specifications. They may think that a POFOD of 0.001 (1failure in 1000 demands) represents a relatively unreliable system. However, as I have explained, if demands for a service are uncommon, it actually represents a very high level of reliability.</p>
<p>If you specify reliability as a metric, it is obviously important to assess that the required level of reliability has been achieved. You do this assessment as part of system testing. To assess the reliability of a system statistically, you have to observe a number of failures. If you have, for example, a POFOD of 0.0001 (1 failure in 10,000 demands), then you may have to design tests that make 50 or 60 thousand demands on a system and where several failures are observed. It may be practically impossible to design and implement this number of tests. Therefore, over-specification of reliability leads to very high testing costs.</p>
<p>When you specify the availability of a system, you may have similar problems. While a very high level of availability may seem to be desirable, most systems have very intermittent demand patterns (e.g. a business system will mostly be used during normal business hours) and a single availability figure does not really reflect user needs. You need high availability when the system is being used but not at other times. Depending, of course, on the type of system, there may be no real practical difference between an availability of 0.999 and an availability of 0.9999.</p>
<p>A fundamental problem with over-specification is that it may be practically impossible to show that a very high level of reliability or availability has been achieved. For example, say a system was intended for use in a safety-critical application and was therefore required to never fail over its total lifetime. Assume that 1,000 copies of the system are to be installed and the system is executed 1,000 times per second. The projected lifetime of the system is 10 years. The total number of system executions is therefore approximately 3*10<sup>14</sup>. There is no point in specifying that the rate of occurrence of failure should be 1/10<sup>15</sup> executions (this allows for some safety factor) as you cannot test the system for long enough to validate this level of reliability.</p>
<p>Organizations must therefore be realistic about whether it is worth specifying and validating a very high level of reliability. High reliability levels are clearly justified in systems where reliable operation is critical, such as telephone switching systems, or where system failure may result in large economic losses. They are probably not justified for many types of business or scientific systems. Such systems have modest reliability requirements, as the costs of failure are simply processing delays and it is straightforward and relatively inexpensive to recover from these.</p>
