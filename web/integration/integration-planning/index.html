				Integration planning			</h1>
			</header><div class="entry-content clearfix">
		<p>When planning integration, you have to decide the order of integration of components. In an agile process, the customer is involved in the development process and decides which functionality should be included in each system increment. Therefore, system integration is driven by customer priorities. In other approaches to development when off-the-shelf components and specially developed components are integrated, the customer may not be involved and the integration team decides on the integration priorities.</p>
<p>In such a situation, you should normally start by integrating component that provide common services to other components. Often these will be external components or COTS. You should then integrate those components that implement the most frequently used system features. This means that the components that are most used receive the most testing. For example, in the Mentcare system, you should start by integrating the basic features to create, view and update a simple patient record. You should then add the functionality to authenticate users then progressively add the components that implement other system features, such as appointment management and report generation.</p>
<p>Of course, reality is rarely as simple as this model suggests. The implementation of system features may be spread across a number of components. To test a new feature, you may have to integrate several components at the same time. The testing may reveal errors in the interactions between these individual components and other parts of the system. Repairing errors may be difficult because a group of components that implement the system feature may have to be changed. Furthermore, integrating and testing a new component can change the pattern of already tested component interactions. Errors may be revealed that were not exposed in the tests of the simpler configuration.</p>
<p>These problems mean that when a new increment is integrated, you should rerun the tests for previous increments as well as the new tests that are required to verify the new system functionality. Rerunning an existing set of tests is called regression testing. If regression testing exposes problems, then you have to check whether these are problems in the previous increment that the new increment has exposed or whether these are due to the added increment of functionality. I say more about regression testing in the next section, which covers test-first development.</p>
